jQuery plugin.

A silly little ditty that basically sits some 
classes onto an element depending on the 
time of day.

Basic use ..

$('body').chronoClass();

You can enable days of week, and period of day ..

$('body').chronoClass({
   dayOfWeek:true,
   timeOfDay:false
});

If it is friday afternoon it will do the following 
if you have true set to the options above ..

<body class="fri afternoon"></body>

You can then make it look like a sexy beer
 garden or whatever your ill be.
 
Read the code if you need more info, 
or tell me what you wanna know and 
I'll write it here you swine.

I'd like to thank The Smiths 
for musical accompaniment whilst I wrote it, yeah?
