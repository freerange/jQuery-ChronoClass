jQuery plugin.

A silly little ditty that basically sits some 
classes onto an element depending on the 
time of day.

Basic use ..

$('body').chronoClass();

You can enable days of week, and period of day ..

$('body').chronoClass({
   dayOfWeek:true,
   timeOfDay:false
});
 
Read the code if you need more info, 
or tell me what you wanna know and 
I'll write it here you swine.

I'd like to thank The Smiths 
for musical accompaniment whilst I wrote it, yeah?
